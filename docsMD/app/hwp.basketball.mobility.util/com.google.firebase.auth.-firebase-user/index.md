| Name | Summary |
|---|---|
| [getFireBaseDBEmail](get-fire-base-d-b-email.md) | `fun FirebaseUser.getFireBaseDBEmail(): `[`String`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-string/index.html)<br>Firebase has certain characters which cannot be used as part of the key. I wanted to organize data to be more browsable, and wanted to use email as key, so i had to replace '.' with ',' and then used that value as key for users. |
